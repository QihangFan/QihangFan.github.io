# About

This is a Git repository for creating a very basic webpage. At a minimum you need an `index.html` file (it needs to be called that).

# Notes
This file is a `markdown` file (note how the file extension is `.md`). It's common (and best practice) to have a `README.md` file for all of your repositories. It's a place to document what your overall code project is about, how to work with it, and how to contribute to it as well.
