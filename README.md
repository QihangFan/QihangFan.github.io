This web project results from the exploration of the overlapping fields of architecture design, digital media practice, user experience design, and immersive web experience. It allows audiences to discover design features interactively and responsively within a website presentation format for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Users can navigate in the virtual environment regarding both macro and micro observation levels. It suggests the possible format of future NFT architectural products following the Web 3.0 and Metaverse tides.

Contemporary fashion houses introduce a small upcycling handicraft workflow, but their factory typology is insufficient to support the nonlinear designers' activities. The media design aims to express the new Garden Factory Typologies that evoke humanity and resist conventional industrial mechanization trends. They represent emerging fashion houses that produce small batches of upcycled collections from the micro to the macro scale. And the decentralized factory typology miniatures blended with local environments - the market, the city, the nature, and the farm - are reinvented.

# Production
Multiple skills are involved in the entire production process.
  - 3D software for architecture and digital media production, including Rhino, Cinema 4D, and Redshift.
  - Adobe Suite for the media post-production
  - Figma for the responsive web and user experience design
  - Webstorm for the front-end development
  - Visual Studio Code to achieve the local hosting for the mobile-end development
<br><br><br>

# About Design

## Background
The studio aims at designing a new Garden Factory for emerging fashion houses like Duran Lantink and Collina Strada to produce small-batch upcycled collections under the umbrella of Prada Group S.p.A. The design topics cover six discourses:
  - Topic 01. Architectural Types — (Fashion) House & Factory
  - Topic 02. Motion Space — Runways IRL, AR, VR
  - Topic 03. Interfaces — Physical/Digital Cameras, Rigs
  - Topic 04. Phygital Material Creation
  - Topic 05. Upcycling — New Forms of Luxury
  - Topic 06. Production Landscapes <br><br>

## Research
The fundamental research explored the upcycling concept that avant-garde fashion houses advocate and practice contemporarily. The upcycling design process includes 7 phases – deadstock dive, deconstruction, categorization, ideation, combination, reconstruction, and audition. However, fashion designers would go through multiple rounds of iteration and leap back and forth to compose the most satisfying pieces. The upcycling production workflow challenges the traditional linear and circular mechanical assembly line and raises the awareness of humanity. In that case, the direct dimension scaling would not work. New factory typologies and spaces need to be redefined.
<br><br>

## Major Concepts
- **Macro vs Micro**

A factory that resists mechanization trends should maintain original functionality while emphasizing human-centered spaces. On the one hand, the Macro Scale indicates our programmatic consideration of the architecture adaption. Each typology iterates and interacts with the local environment. On the other hand, the Micro Scale suggests human involvement in all production processes, like Duran Lantink. Production activities no longer happen in a linear way but jump among various spaces presented in typological miniatures.

- **Decentralization**

A centralized factory seeks the best efficiency. It highlights the simplification of the production process in order to maximize profit. Commercialization resulting from centralization damages human interaction and creativity. Therefore, we emphasize decentralization in the quasi-autonomous factory system to evoke the consciousness of humanity’s sustainability.
